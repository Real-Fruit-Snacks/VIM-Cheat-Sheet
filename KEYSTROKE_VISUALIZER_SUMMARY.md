# Keystroke Visualizer Feature Implementation

## Overview
A professional keystroke visualizer has been implemented for VIM.io that displays keystrokes in real-time. This feature is perfect for streaming, teaching, or creating tutorials.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Core Functionality
- **Real-time keystroke capture**: All keystrokes are captured and displayed
- **Smart key formatting**: Shows modifiers (Ctrl, Alt, Shift, Cmd) separately from main keys
- **Special key symbols**: Converts special keys to readable symbols (e.g., Enter → ↵, Tab → ⇥)
- **Rolling buffer**: Maintains a configurable number of recent keystrokes
- **Smooth animations**: Fade-in animation for new keystrokes, fade-out for old ones

### 2. Customization Options
- **Enable/Disable toggle**: Turn the visualizer on/off as needed
- **Position**: Choose from 6 positions (bottom-left/center/right, top-left/center/right)
- **Font size**: Small, medium, or large text sizes
- **Max keystrokes**: Display 1-10 recent keystrokes
- **Display duration**: Adjust how long keystrokes remain visible (0.5s - 5s)

### 3. User Interface
- **Settings button**: Located in bottom-left corner with green indicator when enabled
- **Settings menu**: Clean, intuitive interface for all customization options
- **Persistent settings**: All preferences saved to localStorage
- **Dark theme integration**: Matches VIM.io's aesthetic perfectly

### 4. Technical Implementation

#### Files Created:
- `/src/hooks/useKeystrokeVisualizer.ts` - Core hook managing keystroke state
- `/src/components/KeystrokeOverlay.tsx` - Overlay component displaying keystrokes
- `/src/components/KeystrokeVisualizerButton.tsx` - Settings button and menu

#### Files Modified:
- `/src/components/VimEditor.tsx` - Added onKeyPress prop to forward keyboard events
- `/src/App.tsx` - Integrated all components
- `/src/index.css` - Added animations and custom range slider styles

### 5. Performance Optimizations
- **Efficient cleanup**: Old keystrokes removed automatically
- **Optimized animations**: 20fps update rate for smooth visuals
- **Minimal overhead**: No impact on typing performance

## Usage

1. Click the settings button in the bottom-left corner
2. Enable the visualizer with the toggle switch
3. Customize position, size, and other settings as needed
4. Start typing - all keystrokes will be displayed!

## Design Highlights
- **Professional appearance**: Clean, modern design with subtle animations
- **Color coding**: Modifiers in blue, main keys in green
- **Backdrop blur**: Semi-transparent background for better readability
- **Smooth transitions**: Fade and slide animations for better UX

## Perfect For:
- **Live streaming**: Show viewers exactly what keys you're pressing
- **Video tutorials**: Help students follow along with vim commands
- **Teaching sessions**: Make it easier to demonstrate complex key combinations
- **Screen recordings**: Create more informative vim tutorials

The implementation is fully integrated with the existing VIM.io codebase and works seamlessly with the Which-Key feature.
