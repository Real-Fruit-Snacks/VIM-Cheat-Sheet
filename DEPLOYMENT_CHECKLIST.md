# Deployment Checklist

Complete checklist for deploying VIM.io in production environments.

## üìã Pre-Deployment Verification

### Build Verification
- [ ] Run `./verify-offline-build.sh` - all checks pass
- [ ] Run `./generate-checksums.sh` - checksums generated
- [ ] Verify gitlab-public/ contains all necessary files (~14 files)
- [ ] Confirm total size is approximately 7-8MB
- [ ] Check no node_modules or source files in gitlab-public/

### Security Review

- [ ] Test in Firefox - with proper headers
- [ ] Test in Safari - if supported in environment
- [ ] Verify all VIM commands work correctly
- [ ] Test copy/paste functionality

## üöÄ Deployment Steps

### For GitLab Pages

- [ ] Verify .gitlab-ci.yml is appropriate for environment
- [ ] Check pipeline runs successfully
- [ ] Wait for Pages to activate (first time: 30-60 min)
- [ ] Verify site loads at GitLab Pages URL

### For Offline Deployment
- [ ] Create offline bundle: `./create-offline-bundle.sh`
- [ ] Transfer bundle via approved method (USB, etc)
- [ ] Extract bundle in target environment
